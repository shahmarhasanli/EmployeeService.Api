# Employee Service Api

Orchestrated Saga example with:
- .Net 6
- EntityFrameWorkCore
- In Memory-by default/Ms Sql


## Running this project

Running should be easy enough since I added in memory database as default.It can be changed in infrastructure by uncommenting sql connection.

However, it will need to manually connect to the SQL Server instance to create the database.

Default database name is `ems-db`.
